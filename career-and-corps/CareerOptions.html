				<!-- information about software engineers -->
					<p>&quot;A software engineer develops various applications that enable users to accomplish tasks on their personal computers and electronic devices. Often, software engineers are employed by software publishers or computer systems design firms.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Software engineers have extensive knowledge of programming languages, software development, and computer operating systems, and they apply engineering principles to software creation. 
						By applying these engineering principles to every stage of the development process, from requirements analysis to the software process, they can create customized systems for individual clients.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Software developers use various source debuggers and visual development environments to modify, write, and debug software for client applications.&quot;</p>
