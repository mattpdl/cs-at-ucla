					<p>
						Computer science is the study of computers with a focus on the theory, design, development, 
						and application of software. CS makes the digitalization of anything possible, 
						and anything that is digital in any way was likely touched by a computer scientist at some point.
						Computer science is used for navigation, safety, communication, and for many other purposes.

					<p>
						Artificial intelligence is the ability to create and develop programs that simulate human intelligence. 
						This application allows for the accomplishment of certain tasks that are beyond human capabilities.
					</p>
					<p>Examples of AI:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Self-driving automobiles</li>
							<li>User-specific data processing</li>
						</ul>
					<p>
						Artificial intelligence is vastly critical to our daily lives. 
						It plays an important role in what we view in social media, while browsing the web, and daily conveniences.

			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-xs-2 col-sm-6"></div>
				<div class="col-xs-10 col-sm-6 jumbotron">
					Computer science is important because it facilitates the progress of a variety of other fields. 
					For example, recent advances in machine learning have proven to be useful in cases ranging from the diagnosis of medical illnesses to the analysis of global markets.

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-4 card card-body">Why did you choose Computer Science?</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-xs-2 col-sm-6"></div>
				<div class="col-xs-10 col-sm-6 jumbotron">
					I chose computer science because I enjoyed the problems it presented and the thought that went into solving them. 
					Moreover, I was always captivated by computers so programming seemed like a good way to indulge my curiosity.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-4 card card-body">How do you think Computer Science affects our daily lives?</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-xs-2 col-sm-6"></div>
				<div class="col-xs-10 col-sm-6 jumbotron">
					Most notably, computer science has entirely changed the method with which we interact with the rest of the world. 
					The action of communicating with people across the world has become as trivial as talking to anybody on the street.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-4 card card-body">What is your favorite language?</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-xs-2 col-sm-6"></div>
				<div class="col-xs-10 col-sm-6 jumbotron">
					Python, it abstracts away a lot of syntactical complexity and allows the user to focus more on the actual algorithm.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-4 card card-body">Do you have any notable professional/research experience?</div>
			</div>
