            This laboratory, led by Dr. Mani Srivastava, conducts research
            "in the broad area of embedded and cyber-physical systems for
            applications in IoT, ubiquitous and mobile computing,
            and pervasive sensing and control.” The Network & Embedded Systems
            Laboratory is a multi-disciplinary lab as it conducts research in the
            Electrical & Computer Engineering Department and the Computer Science
            Department. The main interests are in problems related to "making these
            systems learning-enabled, secure, privacy-aware, human-coupled,
            wirelessly-networked, and energy-efficient." The Network & Embedded Systems
            Laboratory uses a full-stack approach in their research, as all forms of
            software and hardware are worked on.

            The Center for Vision, Cognition, Learning, and Autonomy Research Group at
            UCLA affiliates with both the Computer Science and the Statistics Departments.
            Right now, the group focuses on researching computer vision. However, the group
            has previously conducted studies in automation, communications, language,
            social sciences, and artificial intelligence. VCLA's objective is to "pursue a
            unified framework for representation, learning, inference and reasoning,
            and to build intelligent computer systems for real world applications.”

            WiNG at UCLA focuses on six main areas of wireless
            networking: Mobile Analytics, Mobile Verifications, 5G Mobile Networks, WiFi
            Networks, Voice/Data Security, and Network Function Verification (NFV).
            WiNG's focus is on "design, implementation and experimentation of

            The Cognitive Systems Laboratory at UCLA is led by Dr. Judea Pearl and
            conducts research on five different topics: evidential reasoning, the
            distributed interpretation of multi-source data in networks of partial
            beliefs; learning, the structuring and parameterizing links in belief
            networks to form a representation consistent with a stream of observations;
            constraint processing, delving into intelligent backtracking, learning
            while searching, restructuring constraint networks, truth maintenance
            systems, and temporal reasoning; graphoids, the characterization of
            informational dependencies and their graph representations; and default
            reasoning, studying qualitative probabilistic reasoning, or the drawing of
            plausible and defensible conclusions from incomplete information.

            The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is the largest computer
            science student organization at UCLA. The general club is made of eight smaller
            clubs that focus on one topic of computer science. These clubs include
            Artificial Intelligence, Diversity, Cybersecurity, Design, Teach LA,
            Competitive Programming, Game Design, and Hack. Each club holds
            info sessions, workshops, competitions, and outreach events for their
            respective area of interest. ACM is open to students of all majors.

            The Association for Women in Computing (AWC) was founded in 1978. AWC was
            one of the first professional organizations for women in computing and
            remains to be one of the most influential as well. The goal of AWC is to
            help women advance in technology fields. This is all accomplished by giving
            back to help young women through outreach events, networking, and mentorship.

            The Computing Research Association (CRA) was formed in 1972. For the past 47
            years, CRA has aimed to enhance innovation by joining with industry,
            government, and academia. This is all achieved to strengthen research and
            the fundamentals of advanced education in computing. CRA constantly informs
            both policy makers and the public on current events within the field of
            computer science.
