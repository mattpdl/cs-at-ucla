                            I chose engineering because I have always excelled in math and I knew engineering involved math, 
                                so I thought it would be a good fit. 
                            I also attended two STEM camps where I was exposed to various fields of engineering. 
                            I really enjoyed the various aspects of engineering, so I decided to stick with it. 
                            I want to be an engineer because we can see the results of our work in everyday life. 
                            Also, if you have an idea, you have the ability to bring your dream into reality. 
                            Seeing the finished result/vision of something motivates me. 
                            Once I see the final product of what I&#39;ve been working on, 
                                I know all the hard work I put into that project was worth it. 
                            I am interested in computer science because it applies to so many aspects of our lives, 
                                especially now with the digitization of everything. 
                            Also, you have to think outside of the box to solve some coding questions, which I like.

                            I chose engineering because I want to make a positive impact on the world. 
                            I pursue this area of study to do exactly that. 
                            I have a dream to one day connect the brain to a computer. 
                            I can say this with confidence because technology is improved upon at an extremely high rate. 
                            In the present day it does not seem so far out of the realm of possibility. 
                            It&#39;s hard to imagine just how much farther we will improve in the next couple of years.

                            When I realized I could someday become Iron Man with engineering, I decided that I would become an engineer. 
                            My fascination with math and science only made me even more sure that I wanted to pursue a career in engineering. 
                            After learning more about engineering and what could be accomplished through it, 
                                I also realized that I wanted to help the world in some way, to benefit society as a whole. 
                            Obviously, there are also several other factors that have motivated me to pursue engineering, like the pay. 
                            I specifically chose Computer Engineering however, because I realized that I really like computers, 
                                and as I learned more about them and how they work, 
                                I realized that I really wanted to work with robots and computer systems in the future, 
                                and in choosing Computer Engineering, I can learn about both the software and hardware side of computers, 
                                which is ultimately necessary if you are trying to build a computer or a robot.

                            The day I first wondered how a computer worked showed that I have the curiosity of a scientist. 
                            However, the day I first wondered how to make a computer follow my instructions 
                                was when I first aspired to be an engineer. 
                            I&#39;ve always appreciated how engineering takes the world&#39;s collective knowledge 
                                and creates something for humanity&#39;s benefit. 
                            Within engineering, it has always been computer science that fascinates me the most. 
                            Computing has impacted numerous aspects of society, from business and communication to education and health. 
                            Being a part of Generation Z, I grew up to see the internet, social media, 
                                and mobile devices come to dominate everyday life. 
                            These changes have mostly been for the better, and I&#39;m excited to see how new trends, 
                                such as the internet of things and artificial intelligence, 
                                bring computing everywhere and make computers smarter.
